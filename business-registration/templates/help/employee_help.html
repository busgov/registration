<h3>Employees</h3>
<div>
	<p>Generally, employees:
		<ul>
			<li>are supervised by an employer</li>
			<li>are required to carry out their work in a particular way</li>
			<li>earn a wage or salary</li>
			<li>are entitled to paid leave</li>
			<li>work set hours on a permanent, fixed term or casual basis</li>
			<li>can't subcontract work tasks given to them.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Don't confuse employees with contractors! Contractors set up businesses to hire out their services to other businesses, and can negotiate their own working arrangements.</p>
	<p>If you're not sure whether you'll be taking on an employee or a contractor, try our <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/business-structures-and-types/independent-contractors/Pages/independent-contractors-decision-tool.aspx" target="_blank">Independent contractors decision tool<img class="ico-external" alt="Links to another web site" src="../assets/img/ico-external.png"></a>.
