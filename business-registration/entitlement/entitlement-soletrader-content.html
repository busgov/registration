                <p>This shows us that you're committed to starting your business.</p>
                <p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/business-topics/templates-and-downloads/checklists/starting-a-business-checklist/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Starting a business checklist</a> for other common things people do when they set up a business, and come back when you've completed several steps.</p>
