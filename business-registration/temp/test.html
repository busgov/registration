<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">
    <p>A partnership structure is relatively inexpensive and easy to set up and operate.</p>
    <p>In a partnership structure, <strong>you and your business partners own the business together</strong> and share the income and losses of the business. A partnership can have two or more partners.</p>
<blockquote><hr><p>You're in a <em>family</em> partnership structure if two or more of the partners are related.</p><hr></blockquote>
    <p>Each partner reports their share of the income on their own individual tax return, and pays tax at their <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/" target="_blank">individual income tax rate <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a>. The partnership must lodge a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/reports-and-returns/income-tax-return/#Partnershipsandpartners" target="_blank">partnership income tax return <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> every year with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<blockquote><hr><p><strong>Tax File Number (TFN):</strong> A partnership needs its own TFN. The good news is you <strong>don't need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue a partnership with a TFN (if one doesn't already exist).</p><hr></blockquote>
    <p>All partners share legal responsibility for the business. This means the personal assets of all partners are at risk if things go wrong. If some partners want to limit their responsibility for business losses, you might want to consider a limited partnership structure. See below for more information.</p>
    <p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
<blockquote><hr>
    <h4>Example of a partnership</h4>
    <p>Greg and Fiona operate their website business as a partnership. The partnership has its own tax file number (TFN).</p>
    <p>A partnership is not a separate legal entity and doesn't pay income tax on the income it earns. Instead, Greg and Fiona pay tax on their share of the net partnership income they each receive.</p>
    <p>While the partnership doesn't pay tax, it does have to lodge an annual partnership tax return to show all income the partnership earned and deductions it claimed for expenses it incurred in carrying on the partnership business. The tax return also shows each partner's share of the net partnership income.</p>
<hr></blockquote>
    <h4>Key facts for partnerships</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost</strong> - low cost to set up and run</li>
        <li><strong>Setting up process</strong> - relatively easy</li>
        <li><strong>Owner</strong> - you and your partners</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for business decisions</strong> - you and your partners share</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for losses</strong> - you and your partners share</li>
        <li><strong>Report business income</strong> - each partner reports their share in their individual tax return</li>
        <li><strong>Tax rate</strong> - all partners pay their individual tax rate on their share of any business profit</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of losing assets</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Additional administration</strong> - if partners' shares aren't equal, a partnership agreement is required</li>
        <li><strong>Business tax file number (TFN) needed</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Additional reporting</strong> - yes, an annual partnership return must be lodged at the ATO under the business TFN</li>
        <li><strong>Separate business bank account needed</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Your superannuation</strong> - you're not considered an employee, so you're responsible for organising your own superannuation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Limited partnerships</h4>
    <p>In a limited partnership, there are two types of partners: a general partner and a limited partner. There must be at least one of each.</p>
    <p>General partners are responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and their responsibility for losses (their liability for debt) is unlimited. Limited partners don't play any role in the day-to-day management of the business, and their liability for debt is limited to the amount they contributed to the partnership.</p>
    <p>You <strong>must</strong> register a limited partnership in your state or territory. Contact your <a href="http://www.australia.gov.au/about-government/states-territories-and-local-government" target="_blank">state or territory government <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> to find out more.</p>

<h3 data-collapse-summary="" aria-expanded="false"><a href="#">Companies</a></h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">
    <p>A company structure has higher costs and is more difficult to set up. Running a company can also be more expensive, because you have to meet reporting and other requirements under Australian company law. This is why the structure is generally considered to be better suited to medium to large businesses.</p>
    <p>A company structure means that your business is a <strong>separate legal entity from you</strong>. This means the company has the same rights as a natural person and can have debt, sue and be sued. A company is owned by its shareholders and run by its directors.</p>
    <p>The personal assets of directors and shareholders are separate from the company, so they can't be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses.</p>
    <p>The income and losses that the business makes belongs to the company, and is reported on a company tax return. The <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Small-business-entity-concessions/Concessions/Income-tax-concessions/Small-business-company-tax-rate/" target="_blank">company tax rate <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> applies to the business income.</p>

    <h4>Proprietary limited company</h4>
<p>Companies can be proprietary (private) or public. Most companies in Australia are proprietary limited. A proprietary limited company generally isn't allowed to raise money from the public by selling shares (like public companies can).</p>
    <p>They must have:</p>
    <ul>
<li>no more than 50 non-employee shareholders</li>
        <li>at least one shareholder (also known as a member)</li>
        <li>at least one director.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can be both a shareholder and a director. You can also be the sole shareholder and director.</p>

    <p>When companies are 'limited', the liability of shareholders is limited to any unpaid value (if any) on their shares. This means that shareholders can only be responsible for company losses <strong>up to</strong> any amount unpaid on their shares.</p>

    <h4>Example of a company</h4>
    <p>Mary runs her business as a company and the money the business earns belongs to the company. The company must have a separate bank account.</p>
    <p>Companies have to lodge an annual company tax return, which shows the company's income, deductions and income tax it is liable to pay.</p>
<hr></blockquote>

 <h4>Public companies</h4>
    <p>Unlike private companies, public companies can have an unlimited number of non-employee shareholders and raise money from the public by selling shares. A public company must have at least one shareholder, one secretary, and three directors.</p>
    <h4>Key facts for companies</h4>

<h3 data-collapse-summary="" aria-expanded="false"><a href="#">Trusts</a></h3>
<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">
    <p>Using a <strong>trust</strong> structure for a business means that the business is held and controlled by a trustee for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</p>
    <p>A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses, and must report income in a trust income tax return.</p>
    <p>A trustee can be a company or a person.</p>
    <h4>Key facts for trusts</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost</strong> - higher cost to set up</li>
        <li><strong>Setting up process</strong> - complicated</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for business decisions</strong> - trustee</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for debts</strong> - trustee</li>
        <li><strong>Report business income</strong> - on trust income tax return</li>
        <li><strong>The money you get from the business</strong> - as a beneficiary, you report any distributions on your individual tax return (if you're the trustee and there is net trust income, you're taxed at the highest marginal tax rate)</li>
        <li><strong>Tax rate</strong> - depending on the trust deed, the trust may need to pay at the company tax rate. If all income is distributed to adult beneficiaries who are Australian residents, the trust doesn't need to pay tax.</li>
	<li><strong>Business Tax file number (TFN) needed</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Additional administration</strong> - the trustee is responsible for formal deed and yearly administrative tasks</li>
        <li><strong>Additional reporting</strong> - yes, the trustee is responsible for annual company tax return and other requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Separate bank account</strong> - yes</li>

<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;"> 
	<p>All partnerships and companies need a business TFN to deal with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), for example to report business income and deductions. </p>
<p>The good news is you <strong>don't need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue a partnership or company with a TFN (if one doesn't already exist).</p>

<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;">
    <p>If you run a business in Australia, you should have an ABN.</p>
    <p>An ABN is a unique 11 digit number that identifies your business to the public, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and other government agencies. Applying for an ABN is free.</p>
    <h4>Why should I have an ABN?</h4>
    <p>Having an ABN means you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
        <li>avoid having business clients withhold 46.5% of any payments they make to you</li>
        <li>register a business name</li>
        <li>register an Australian domain name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You also need to have an ABN if you register for Goods and Services Tax (GST)</p>
