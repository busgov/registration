<div aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;"><h4>Where to now?</h4>
<p>There are a number of registrations you may still need before you can start trading. State and territories have various licences and permits that are often required prior to starting your business or company.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://ablis.business.gov.au/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Australian Business Licence and Information Service (ABLIS) <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> to find the licences and permits you need to run your business.</p>
<h4>How do I change my form details?</h4>
<p>If you’ve made a mistake in your company or business name, you must <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/contact-us/" target="_blank">notify ASIC <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> within 24 hours after the registration. Generally if there’s a typing error (e.g. letters are mixed up or missing), ASIC will correct it.</p>
<p>If your details have changed, you have 28 days from when you were aware of the change to:
</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Registration/Update-your-details/" target="_blank">update your tax registration details <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/renewing-and-maintaining-your-business-name/update-your-business-name-details/how-to-update-business-name-details/" target="_blank">update your business name details <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/changes-to-your-company/" target="_blank">make changes to your company <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a>.</li></ul> <p></p> 
<h4>Are there penalties for incorrect information?</h4>
<p>There are penalties if the information entered is false or misleading. However, if you let the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) or Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) know as soon as you're aware of the error or if you update them before they contact you, you may not receive a penalty. </p>
<p>See the <a href="https://abr.gov.au/General-information/Making-a-false-or-misleading-statement/" target="_blank">Making a false or misleading statement <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> page on the Australian Business Register (ABR) website.</p>
<p>For business name or company details, see the <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/payments-fees-and-invoices/late-fees/" target="_blank">Late fees <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> section of the ASIC website.</p>
<h4>Where can I register for a business TFN?</h4>
<p>If you're registering an ABN for a partnership or company, you'll need a business TFN.</p>
<p>The good news is you <strong>don't need to register</strong>. The ATO will automatically issue a partnership or company with a TFN (if one doesn't already exist).</p>
<h4>Where do I renew my business name?</h4>
<p>See the different options available for <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/renewing-and-maintaining-your-business-name/renew-your-business-name/" target="_blank">renewing your business name <span class="visuallyhidden">(opens in new window)</span></a> on the ASIC website.</p>
