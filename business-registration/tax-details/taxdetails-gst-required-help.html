<h3>Are you required to register for GST?</h3>
<div>
    <p>You must register for GST if you run a business or enterprise and your GST turnover is $75,000 or more ($150,000 or more for non-profit organisations). GST turnover is your business's gross income, not your business's profit.</p>
    <p>It is your responsibility to register if your turnover exceeds the relevant threshold or is likely to exceed it. If you are not registered for GST, check each month to see whether you have reached your threshold. You must register within 21 days of reaching the threshold.</p>
    <p>You must also register for GST, regardless of turnover, if you:</p>
    <ul class="content">
        <li>provide taxi travel</li>
        <li>want to claim fuel tax credits for your business</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your GST turnover is below the threshold, registering for GST is optional. However, if you choose to register, you generally must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
