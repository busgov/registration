<h3>What is a sole trader?</h3>
<div>
<p>A sole trader is the simplest and cheapest business structure you can choose as it has few legal and tax formalities. You report the business's profits on your own individual tax return and pay tax at individual rates, not company tax rates.</p>
<p>Sole traders generally have less reporting and compliance obligations when compared to other business structures. </p>
<p>As a sole trader you are legally responsible for all aspects of the business and debts and losses cannot be shared with other individuals. You are responsible for your own super arrangements and any staff you employ.</p>
<p>As a sole trader you cannot claim deductions for money 'drawn' from the business. Amounts taken from the business are not wages for tax purposes, even if you think of them as wages.</p>
<p>If you aren't sure which business structure to choose, talk to an accountant, tax adviser, solicitor or other business adviser. You can use the <a href="http://www.business.gov.au/advice-and-support/advisor-finder/Pages/default.aspx">advisor finder</a> tool to help locate business advisors in your area.</p>
