Do you have a proposed company name?	<h3>Company name</h3>
<div>
<p>All companies must choose a company name as part of the company registration process.</p>
<p>If you&apos;ve reserved your company name already with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC), choose the &apos;Use a reserved name&apos; option.</p>
<h4>What is a company name?</h4>
<p>A company name is a company&apos;s legal name. This is the name that appears on all official documents and legal papers, such as legal contracts and registrations and property leases.</p>

<p>A company name has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part is a name that you choose (we&apos;ll check that it&apos;s available to register).</li>
<li>The second part identifies the company type (such as proprietary limited).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><hr />For example: Fishing Supplies Proprietary Limited<hr /></blockquote>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to choose a name, you can use the company&apos;s Australian Company Number (ACN) as the first part of your company name. An ACN is a unique 9 digit number that&apos;s issued to your company when it&apos;s registered. On company registration certificates and the company register, names that use the ACN will display with &apos;A.C.N.&apos; at the front.</p>

<blockquote><hr />For example, A.C.N. 123 456 789 Proprietary Limited<hr /></blockquote>

<h4>Do I also need to register a business name?</h4>
<p>If you want to run a business under a name that&apos;s different to the company name, you&apos;ll need to register that name as a business name.</p>


<blockquote><hr /> <p>For example: Jane registers a company with the company name &apos;Farming Partners Pty Ltd&apos;.</p><p>If Jane trades under this exact name (she advertises her company using this name, uses it for her shop signage, etc) then she <strong>doesn&apos;t</strong> need to register a business name.</p> 
<p>If she wants to trade under:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name &apos;Fresh Food&apos;, she <strong>must register</strong> &apos;Fresh Food&apos; as a <strong>business name</strong></li>
<li>&apos;Farming Partners&apos; (without the Pty Ltd), she <strong>must register</strong> &apos;Farming Partners&apos; as a <strong>business name</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</blockquote>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/bn-register">registering a business name</a> on the ASIC website.</p>
</div>
	<h3>Use ACN</h3>
<div>
<p>If you don&apos;t want to create a name, you can simply use your Australian Company Number (ACN) as the company name.</p>

<p>An ACN is a unique 9 digit number that&apos;s issued to your company when it&apos;s successfully registered. You still need to include a legal element to identify the company type. On company registration certificates and the company register, names that use the ACN will display with &apos;A.C.N.&apos; at the front.</p>

<blockquote><hr />For example, A.C.N. 123 456 789 Proprietary Limited.<hr /></blockquote>

	<h3>Regular or continuous basis</h3>
<div><p>When we say &#34;regular&#34;, we mean repeated in a way that follows a general pattern. There’s no set time period for which you must repeat activities. For example, you&apos;re selling regularly if you:

<li>put on exhibitions 3 or 4 times a year to sell your artwork.</li></ul></p>

Body corporates are set up under common law or an Act of Parliament, or registered under a statute. 	<h3>Body corporate</h3>
<div>
<p>A body corporate is set up by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing it under common law</li>
<li>establishing it under an Act of Parliament, or</li>
<li>registering it under a statute.</li>
</ul>
<p>A body corporate is a legal entity that is separate from its individual members. It can act, hold property, enter into legal contracts, sue and be sued in its own name.</p>
</div>

A corporation that consists of a particular position, such as a bishop in a church.	<h3>Corporation sole</h3>
<div>
<p>A corporation sole is set up by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing it under common law</li>
<li>establishing it under an Act of Parliament, or</li>
<li>registering it under a statute.</li>
</ul>
<p>A corporation sole is a corporation that consists of a particular position, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>an archbishop</li>
<li>a bishop in a church</li>
<li>a minister of the Crown.</li>
</ul>
<p> A corporation sole is separate from the individual who occupies the position. The position is a legal entity, no matter who holds the position, and even if the position is vacant from time to time.</p>
<p>In the name of the position, a corporation sole can own property, sue and be sued.</p>
</div>

Companies set up outside Australia or in an external territory of Australia (such as Christmas Island).	<h3>Foreign company</h3>
<div>
<p>A foreign company is a company that was set up:</p>
<ul><li>outside Australia or</li>
<li>in an external territory of Australia, such as Christmas Island or Norfolk Island.</li>
</ul>
<p>To carry on business in Australia, foreign companies must register with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC). Once registered, they will get a unique 9 digit Australian Registered Body Number (ARBN).</p>

Organisations like clubs or community groups that are incorporated under state or territory law.	<h3>Incorporated association</h3>
<div>
<p>Incorporated associations are usually clubs or community groups that have decided to give their organisation a formal legal structure.</p>
<p>Incorporated associations usually have at least five members. They must use all profits to achieve the association&apos;s aims.</p>
<p>When a club or group incorporates, it becomes a separate legal entity (separate from its members). It can do things in its own name, such as lease a property or be sued. This protects the members from any legal liability.</p>
<p>Associations are incorporated under state or territory legislation. They can only operate in that state or territory.</p>
<blockquote><hr />To operate outside its state or territory of incorporation, an incorporated association must <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/how-to-start-a-company/registrable-australian-bodies/">register with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC)</a> under the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.<hr /></blockquote>

	<h3>Will the company be governed by a constitution?</h3>
<div>
<p>A public company must have rules for how it will be governed or managed. For example, rules for how directors will be appointed and how shareholder meetings will be organised.</p>
<p>Most companies can be governed by a constitution, replaceable rules, or a combination of both.</p>

<h4>Replaceable rules</h4>
<p>Replaceable rules are a basic set of rules for managing a company. They are set out in the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.</p>

<p>Using replaceable rules means you don’t need to worry about having or maintaining your own written constitution (or dealing with the expense of keeping the constitution up to date with the law).</p>

<p>These rules are called &apos;replaceable&apos; rules because you can replace all or some of the rules with a constitution.</p>


<p>Read an outline of the <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/starting-a-company/constitution-and-replaceable-rules/replaceable-rules-outlined/">replaceable rules</a> on the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) website.</p>

<h4>Constitution</h4>

<p>A company can use its own constitution instead of the replaceable rules, or use a constitution to replace some of the replaceable rules.</p>
<p>If the company has more than one shareholder (member), they must all agree to the terms and conditions of a constitution before the company can adopt it.</p>

<blockquote><hr />If your company will be governed by a constitution (either fully or partly), you&apos;ll need to upload a copy in the next step of the form.<hr /></blockquote>

Don&#39;t need an Australian Business Number (ABN)&#63;	
<p>In most cases, you need an ABN to apply for a business name. You can apply <strong>without</strong> an ABN if you operate only on Christmas or Cocos Island or you&apos;re applying as a joint venture.</p>
<p><strong>Have your ABN details changed?</strong> If so, you’ll need to <a href="https://abr.gov.au/update-abn">notify the ABR Registrar</a> separately.</p>	
	<h3>I already have an ABN</h3>
<div><p>If you already have an active Australian Business Number (ABN), enter it in the field provided to continue with your registration.</p> 
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Your new registrations will be linked to the ABN you enter here.</p>

<h4>Can I use my old ABN?</h4>
<p>If you have a cancelled ABN and want to use it for your new business, you&apos;ll need to go back to the previous screen and select the ABN application. </p>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office will then assess your application and let you know if you can use your old ABN or they&apos;ll issue you with a new one.</p> </div>

If you&apos;ve applied for an ABN but it&apos;s still in progress.	<h3>I have an ABN reference number</h3>
<div><p>The ABN reference number is a 13 digit number issued when your ABN application is being processed, but not complete.</p><p> You can find your reference number on your ABN registration confirmation.</p></div>
	<h3>Christmas Island or Cocos Island </h3>
<div>

<p>You can register a business name without an ABN if you operate <strong>solely</strong> on Christmas Island or Cocos (Keeling) Island.</p>
<p>You&apos;ll need to tell us whether you&apos;re:</p>
<ul>
<li>an individual (sole trader)</li>
<li>an organisation with an Australian Company Number (ACN) or Australian Registered Body Number (ARBN)</li>
<li>an organisation with no ACN or ARBN (this includes partnerships and joint ventures).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><hr />ACNs and ARBNs are unique 9 digit numbers issued to companies and other organisations registered with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC).<hr /></blockquote>

A joint venture is usually formed for a specific project or goal with an end date (unlike a partnership, which is usually ongoing). 	<h3>Joint venture (all partners have an ABN)</h3>
<div>
<p>Joint ventures without an ABN can apply for a business name <strong>if all partners in the joint venture</strong> have:</p>
<ul>
<li>their own ABN, or</li>
<li>an ABN application reference number.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&apos;ll need to provide the following information about the joint venture partners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals – their name, birth details and residential address</li>
<li>Companies or registered bodies – their Australian Company Number (ACN) or Australian Registered Body Number (ARBN)</li>
<li>Organisations without an ACN or ARBN (including partnerships) – their ABN and name, and details of a representative for that partner (the representative can be an individual or an incorporated entity).</li>

	<h3>Australian Business Number (ABN)</h3>
<div><p>An ABN is a unique 11 digit number that identifies your business to the public, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and other government agencies.</p>
<p>Applying for an ABN is free, but not everyone is entitled to one.</p>
<h4>Why should I have an ABN? </h4>
<p>If you&apos;re running a business, you&apos;ll need an ABN. Having an ABN means you can:</p>
<ul><li>confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
<li>avoid having business clients withhold a percentage of any payments they make to you </li>
<li>register a business name </li>
<li>register a &apos;.com.au&apos;, &apos;.net.au&apos;, or &apos;.org.au&apos; domain name.</li></ul>
<p>You also need to have an ABN if you register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) </p>

<blockquote><hr /><p>You <strong>don&apos;t</strong> need an ABN if the business is:</p>
<ul>
<li>located in the Christmas or Cocos Islands</li>
<li>a joint venture (where the partners have their own ABNs).</li>
</ul>
<hr /></blockquote>
<h4>Can I use my old ABN?</h4>
<p>If your ABN was <strong>recently</strong> cancelled by the Australian Business Register (ABR), you may not need to submit a new application. Call the ABR on 13 92 26 to see if your ABN can be reinstated over the phone.</p>
<p>If not, complete an ABN application here. If your application is successful, the ABR will either reinstate your old ABN or issue you with a new one.</p>

Before you continue, we need to first check that you’re entitled to an ABN.	
Select the business structure that best describes the business. If you need help deciding on a business structure, see our <a href="http://register.business.gov.au/">Business structure decision tool</a>	
	<h3>Individual (Sole trader)</h3>
<div><p>If you&apos;re a sole trader, you&apos;re the sole owner of the business. The income your business makes belongs to you. You report the income in your personal tax return and pay tax on your business income at your individual tax rate.</p>
<p>You&apos;re responsible for all decisions and losses in your business. This means you have complete control over your business, but it also means your personal assets are at risk if things go wrong.  </p>
<p>If you employ staff, you&apos;re responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p></div>
	<h3>Partnership</h3>
<div><p>In a partnership structure, you and your business partners own the business together and share the income and losses of the business. A partnership can have two to twenty partners. You&apos;re in a family partnership structure if two or more of the partners are related.  </p>
<p>Each partner reports their share of the income in their own personal tax return. An annual partnership return must also be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office. </p>
<p>All partners share legally responsibility for the business. This means the personal assets of all partners are at risk if things go wrong. If some partners want to limit their responsibility for business losses, you might want to consider a limited partnership structure.</p>
<p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p></div>
	<h3>Company</h3> 
<div><p>A company structure means that your business is a separate legal entity from you. This means the company has the same rights as a natural person and can have debt, sue and be sued.</p>
<p>A company must have at least:
<ul><li>one owner (known as a shareholder or member), and</li>
<li>one director (who is responsible for running the business, and for business debts in some cases).</li></ul></p>
<p>You can be both. You can also set up a one person company and not have any other owner or director.  </p>
<p>Shareholders are generally not responsible for any losses, so your personal assets are generally not at risk if things go wrong. </p>
<p>The income and losses that the business makes belongs to the company, and is reported in a company tax return. </p>
<p>If the company employs staff, the company is responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p></div>
	<h3>Trust</h3> 
<div>Using a trust structure for your business means that your business is held and controlled by a trustee for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries). A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses, and must report income in a trust income tax return. A trustee can be a company or a person.</div>
	<h3>Superannuation</h3>
<div>This means all superannuation entities including Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs).</div>
	<h3>Activities carried out in Australia</h3>
<div>If you do not operate in Australia, you may still be entitled to an ABN if you do any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Deliver goods or make goods available in Australia to buyers.</li>
<li>Remove goods from Australia.</li>
<li>Import, install or assemble goods in Australia.</li>
<li>Supply property or land that is located in Australia.</li>
<li>Supply services that are carried out in Australia.</li></ul></div>
Indirect tax zone means Australia, excluding external territories or offshore areas such as Christmas Island, Cocos Island, and the Joint Petroleum Area.	<h3>Supplies connected with the indirect tax zone</h3>
<div><p>Indirect tax zone means Australia, excluding external territories or offshore areas such as Christmas Island, Cocos Island and the Joint Petroleum Area. </p>

<li>Remove goods from Australia</li>
<li>Import, install or assemble goods in Australia.</li>
<li>Supply services that are carried out in Australia</li>
<li>Supply property or land that is located in Australia.</li></ul></p></div>
	<h3>GST only registration</h3>
<div><p>You must register for Goods and Services Tax (GST) if you meet the following criteria:
<ul><li>you are running a business that is not in Australia</li>
<li>still waiting on response on this &#45; your business has sales that are connected with Australia</li> 
<li>your business has GST turnover at or above A$75,000.</li></ul></p>
<p>If your business meets the above criteria but your GST turnover is less than A$75,000, you can still choose to register for GST. </p></div>
	<h3>Started or taking steps to start</h3>
<div><p>If you&apos;re just thinking about starting a business, you&apos;re not eligible for an ABN.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an ABN, we expect you to have taken several steps to starting a business to show you&apos;re committed, such as:
<ul><li>meet with financial or business advisors</li>
<li>write a business plan</li>
<li>estimate your potential business profit</li>
<li>apply for finance</li>
<li>run feasibility studies</li>
<li>lease or buy premises or equipment for the business</li>
<li>obtain licences to operate</li>
<li>advertise your business.</li></ul></p></div>
	<h3>Apprentice, trade assistant or labourer</h3>
<div><p>You don’t need an ABN to work as an apprentice, trade assistant, or labourer. You work under the direction of your employer, so you’re actually an employee. </p>
<p>If your employer is asking you to register as a contractor when you’re really an employee, you can <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Employee-or-contractor/In-detail/Report-a-business-incorrectly-treating-employees-as-contractors/How-to-report-a-business-incorrectly-treating-employees-as-contractors/">report the business to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</a>. </p>

<li>a club or society</li>
<li>a non-profit organisation</li>
<li>a body corporate.</li></ul></div>
	<h3>Renting or leasing out a residential property</h3>
<div>Not all individuals that rent or lease out a residential property need an ABN. However, if these activities are performed on a regular or continuous basis with the intention of making a profit, you&apos;re entitled to an ABN.</div>
Such as land, cars, copyright or patents.	<h3>In the form of a licence, lease or other grant of an interest in property</h3>
<div><p>This is when you have property (such as land, cars, boats, copyright or patents) and you offer a licence, lease or other type of interest in that property to someone else. You&apos;re entitled to an ABN for this activity if you offer this on a regular or continuous basis with the intention of making a profit.</p></div>
Business-like deals or sales that aren&apos;t part of an on-going business..	<h3>One-off commercial transactions not done in the course of a business</h3>
<div>These are financial transactions or business-like deals that are not done as part of an on-going business for example the sale of property.  These transactions are one-off and have a reasonable expectation of profit or gain.</div>
	<h3>Consistent with running a business</h3>
<div><p>These questions are to help you work out whether your activities are consistent with running a business or more like a hobby.</p>
<p>If your business activity isn’t ongoing or repeated, or you’re not planning to make a profit or gain, what you’re doing could be more of a hobby than a business. Hobbies don’t need ABNs. For more about this, read the Australian Taxation Office <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/starting-your-own-business/business-or-hobby-/">Business or hobby?</a> page.</p>
<p>You can also read more about <a href="https://abr.gov.au/For-Business,-Super-funds---Charities/Applying-for-an-ABN/ABN-entitlement/">ABN eligibility</a> on the Australian Business Register website.</p></div>
	<h3>Regular or continuous basis</h3>
<div><p>When we say “regularly”, we mean repeatedly in a way that follows a general pattern. There’s no set time period for which you must repeat activities. For example, you’re selling regularly if you:
<ul><li>set up a stall at your local markets every 4 to 6 weeks to sell your products</li>
<li>put on exhibitions 3 or 4 times a year to sell your artwork.</li></ul></p>
<p>When we say “continuously”, we mean non-stop. For example, if you earn a continuous income from renting out farming land to one tenant for the next 20 years. </p>
<p>If your business activity isn’t ongoing or repeated, or you’re not planning to make a profit or gain, what you’re doing could be more of a hobby than a business. Hobbies don’t need ABNs. For more about this, read the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/starting-your-own-business/business-or-hobby-/">Business or hobby?</a> page.</p></div>
	<h3>Expect to make a profit or gain</h3>
<div>This means that you and others have expectations that your activity will make a profit or gain. These expectations are reasonable and not based on risks or luck.</div>
Please enter your transfer number.	<h3>Transfer number</h3>
<div>
<p>Please enter a transfer number that is:</p>
<ul><li>no more than 23 characters</li>
<li>in the format <strong>n-nnnnnnnnnnn</strong> or <strong>nn-nnnnnnnnnnn</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>If you&apos;ve bought a business and want to use the existing business name, you&apos;ll need the transfer number from the previous owner before you can register it. </p>
<p>If you haven&apos;t received a transfer number from the previous owner, you&apos;ll need to contact them.</p>

</div>
	<h3>Tax agent registration number</h3>
<div><p>The tax agent number (TAN) is an 8 digit number given to tax agents when they are registered.</p>
<p> You can find this number on an income tax return prepared by your tax agent.</p>
<p>If the TAN number you find is only 7 digits, add a &apos;0&apos; at the beginning of your number to complete this field.  </p></div>
Providing your TFN is the quickest way to prove your identity.	<h3>Tax File Number (TFN)</h3>
<div>
<h4>Do I have to provide my TFN?</h4>
<p>No you don&apos;t have to provide your TFN. However, not providing one will delay your application. It may also lead to an unsuccessful application if your identity can&apos;t be confirmed without a TFN. </p>
<h4>Why the delay?</h4>
<p>Without a TFN, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) may need to manually process your application. To do this, the ATO will need you to provide additional information or certified copies of documents including your: </p>
<ul><li>bank account number</li>
<li>birth certificate</li>
<li>passport</li>
<li>driver’s licence.</li></ul>
<h4>Where can I find out more?</h4>
<p>Details on what information the ATO needs to <a href="https://abr.gov.au/General-information/Proving-your-identity/">prove your identity</a> can be found on the ATO website. </p>

Select <strong>one</strong> option that best describes why you need an ABN.	
You have set up, or are about to set up, a new business and have never had an ABN using the same business structure in Australia.	
For example, if you earn income from an investment.	
You have bought or taken over an existing business.	
You are contracting or sub-contracting your services.	
You need an ABN to receive payment for services.	
You have restarted a business in the same business structure.	
You have restarted a business in a different business structure.	
The legal structure of your business has changed. For example, from a partnership to a sole trader.	
	<h3>First time in business</h3>
<div>Answer Yes to this question if you&apos;ve never owned or operated a business in Australia. This includes as a sole trader, partner, trustee, director or contractor/subcontractor.</div>
	<h3>GST start date</h3>
<div><p>If you&apos;re required by law to register for GST, your GST registration should start on the date:
<ul><li>your annual turnover reached &#36;75,000 or more</li>
<li>you started charging passengers for taxi services or limousine travel</li>
<li>you want to start claiming fuel tax credits.</li></ul></p>
<p>If you choose to register for GST, you can choose any start date, as long as it&apos;s the same as or later than your ABN start date.</p></div>
	<h3>GST turnover</h3>
<div><p>GST turnover is your current or projected annual turnover (excluding GST amounts) &#45; whichever is greater. GST turnover is not your profit.</p>
<p>Current annual turnover is:
<ul><li>the value of all sales you made or are likely to make in the current month plus </li>
<li>the value of all sales you made in the previous 11 months.</li></ul></p>
<p>Projected annual turnover is:
<ul><li>the value of all sales you made or are likely to make in the current month plus</li>
<li>the value of all sales you&apos;re likely to make in the next 11 months.</li></ul></p></div>

An individual or a sole trader is where you&apos;re the sole owner of the business, but you can employ staff. You&#39;re responsible for all decisions and losses in your business, and you report the business income in your personal tax return.	<h3>Individual (Sole trader)</h3>
<div><p>If you&#39;re a sole trader, you&#39;re the sole owner of the business. The income your business makes belongs to you. You report the income in your personal tax return and pay tax on your business income at your individual tax rate.</p>
<p>You&#39;re responsible for all decisions and losses in your business. This means you have complete control over your business, but it also means your personal assets are at risk if things go wrong. </p>
<p>If you employ staff, you&#39;re responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
</div>
You and your partners carry on a business together and share income, losses and control of the business. The partners in the partnership are not employees, but the partnerships can employ staff.	<h3>Partnership</h3>
<div>

<p>A partnership is a group of people in business together and who may have a written partnership agreement.</p>

<p>In a partnership structure, you and your partners own the business together and share the income and losses of the business. A partnership can have two or more partners. You&apos;re in a family partnership structure if two or more of the partners are related.</p>

<p>The partnership needs its own TFN and will have to lodge an annual partnership return with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) showing all income and deductions of the business and the distributions to each partner. Also, each partner reports their share of the income or loss in their own personal tax return. Each partner will pay tax on the share of profits they receive.</p>



<p>Select <strong>Partnership</strong> on this form if your partnership is one of the following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Family partnership:</strong> where two or more partners are related.</li>
<li><strong>Other partnership:</strong> where two or more partners form a general partnership.</li></ul>

A company is a separate legal entity from you, and has at least one shareholder or member and one director (who runs the business). Income and losses belong to the company. Companies can employ staff. 	<h3>Company</h3> 
<div><p>A company structure means that your business is a separate legal entity from you. This means the company has the same rights as a natural person and can have debt, sue and be sued.</p>

<p>Companies have minimum shareholder/member and officeholder requirements. For example, a proprietary limited company (the most common company type in Australia) must have at least:</p>
<ul><li>one shareholder</li>
<li>one director (who is responsible for running the business, and for business debts in some cases).</li></ul>

<p>The income and losses that the business makes belongs to the company, and is reported in a company tax return. </p>
<p>If the company employs staff, the company is responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
</div>

Your business is held and controlled for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries). A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses. 	<h3>Trust</h3> 
<div><p>To be considered a trust, you must meet the following. </p>
<ul><li>Your business is held and controlled for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</li>
<li>You have a trustee responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses. This can be a company or a person.</li>
<li>The object or purpose of the trust is implied or in writing, often in the form of a trust deed.</li></ul>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Important:</strong> Applying for an Australian Business Number (ABN) doesn&apos;t automatically make you a trust. You must meet the requirements of a trust above before you&apos;re entitled to an ABN.<hr /></blockquote>
 <p>Trusts are complex to set up and you’ll need time and the right skills to do it properly.</p>
<p>It&apos;s best to see a qualified, licensed professional to help you understand what’s involved and the registrations you&apos;ll need.</p>

<p>We ask this question to help prove your identity to the Australian Taxation Office.</p>
Please select one of the three gender options: <ul> 
<li>Male</li>
<li>Female</li>
<li>Not specified (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified)</li> </ul>
<p>In line with the <strong>Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender</strong> we recognise that individuals may identify as a gender other than the sex they were assigned at birth, or may not identify as exclusively male or female.</p>
<p>For further detail on the guidelines, see the <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/Pages/Australian-Government-Guidelines-on-the-Recognition-of-Sex-and-Gender.aspx">Attorney-General&apos;s</a> website.</p></div>
	<h3>Tax File Number (TFN)</h3>
<div>
<h4>Do I have to provide my TFN?</h4>
<p>If you&apos;re applying for an AUSkey, you <strong>must</strong> provide your TFN.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re <strong>not</strong> applying for an AUSkey, you <strong>don&apos;t</strong> have to provide your TFN. However, not providing one will delay your application by up to 28 days.</p>
<h4>Why the delay?</h4>
<p>Without a TFN, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) may need to manually process your application. To do this, the ATO will need you to provide additional information or certified copies of documents including your: </p>
<ul><li>bank account number</li>
<li>birth certificate</li>
<li>passport</li>
<li>driver’s licence.</li></ul>
<h4>Where can I find out more?</h4>

	<h3>Ultimate holding company</h3>

<div>
<blockquote><hr />
<p><strong>If your company won&apos;t have another company holding or controlling it, answer &apos;no&apos; to this question.</strong></p><hr /></blockquote>

<p>Your company has a <strong>holding company</strong> if another company holds most or all of your company&apos;s shares. Your company is &apos;held&apos; or controlled by the holding company.</p>

<p>A holding company can in turn be held by another company, and so on. The <strong>ultimate holding company</strong> is the company at the top of the chain of ownership. It doesn’t have another company holding it.</p>
<blockquote><hr />
<p>If you&apos;re not sure whether your company will have an ultimate holding company, consider seeking independent legal advice.</p>
<hr /></blockquote>
</div>
Enter your proposed name to check if it&apos;s available to register as a business name. <strong>Remember&#58;</strong> It&apos;s also a good idea to check that the name isn&apos;t already a <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks">trade mark</a> or <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Run/Advertising-and-online/Register-a-website-name">website name</a> before registering.	<h3>Proposed business name</h3>
<div>
<h4>Business name format</h4>
<p>When you enter your business name, it will automatically be converted to <strong>uppercase letters</strong>. The system will also accept the following:</p>
<ul><li>spaces</li>
<li>letters A to Z</li>
<li>numbers 0 to 9</li>
<li>standard punctuation marks such as .  , &#63;  &#33;  &#40;  &#41;  &#123;  &#125;  &#58;  &#59;  ‘  “  ” </li>
<li>the symbols  &#124;  -   _  \   / &#64;  &#35;  &#36;  &#37;  &#42;   &#61;  &amp;</li></ul>
<p>The form <strong>will not</strong> accept letters with an accent such as &#224;, &#233;, &#265; or &#231;.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Example:</strong> Lisa wants to register &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233;&apos;. <br /><br />Although her name will need to be registered as &apos;LISA&apos;S CAFE&apos;, she can still use &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233;&apos; on her marketing, signage and receipts.<hr /></blockquote> 
<h4>Display your name</h4>
<p>You are no longer required to display your business name registration certificate. However, <strong>legally you must</strong> display your name on each:</p>
<ul><li>location where you&apos;re trading to the public, such as shops or stalls at an exhibition</li>
<li>official document, such as quotes, tax invoices and receipts.</li></ul>

<h4>Protect your name</h4>
<p>Not all names are available to register. Names that are identical to a name registered by someone else, contain restricted or prohibited words or expressions can&apos;t be registered. Some names may also require manual processing. Check the <a href="http://asic.gov.au/bn-availability">business naming rules</a> on the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) website to see what can and can&apos;t be registered.</p><p>Even if your proposed name meets the business naming rules, the same name could still be registered by someone else as a trade mark or domain name. If you want exclusive use of your proposed name take the following steps to protect your name.</p>

<ul><li>Before you register the name, make sure you&apos;re not infringing on someone else&apos;s copyright. Visit the IP Australia website for information on <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks">searching for trade marks</a> in Australia and overseas for your proposed business name.</li>
<li>If you want to use your proposed business name as part of your web address, read our <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Run/Advertising-and-online/Register-a-website-name">register a website name</a> page.</li>
<li>Register your business name as a trade mark. Registering a business name doesn&apos;t stop others from using it for a different purpose. For example, even if you&apos;ve registered a business name, others could still use the same name for their products. To get exclusive use, <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</li></ul>

<h4>Multiple names</h4>
<p>Did you know you can register multiple business names. You might want to register multiple names to: </p>
<ul><li>give different parts of your business different identities. For example, Tasty Wholesale Foods and Tasty Catering Services.</li>
<li>make sure others can&apos;t register names that are similar to your business name. For example, Real Tasty Foods, Tasty Party Services, etc.</li></ul>
<h4>Renew a business name</h4>
<p>The Business registration service does not currently process business name renewals. See the different options available for <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/for-business/renewing-and-maintaining-your-business-name/renew-your-business-name/">renewing your business name</a> on the ASIC website.</p>
</div>
	<h3>Goods &#38; Services Tax &#40;GST&#41; </h3>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> register for GST if: </p>
<ul><li>your business has a GST turnover of &#36;75,000 or more</li>
<li>your business charges passengers for taxi services or limousine travel </li>
<li>you want to claim Fuel Tax Credits &#40;FTC&#41;</li>

<h4>How GST works</h4>
<p>GST is a tax of 10&#37; on most goods and services sold in Australia. Generally, businesses that are registered for GST&#58;</p>
<ul><li>collect GST on the goods and services they sell and forward it to the ATO</li>
<li>claim credits for the GST included in the price of goods and services they buy for their business.</li></ul>
<h4>What do I need to do&#63;</h4> 
<p>If you&apos;re registered for GST, you&apos;ll need to: </p>
<ul><li>work out which goods and services you sell are subject to GST</li> 
<li>include GST in the prices you charge for those goods and services </li>
<li>give tax invoices to your customers that include the GST amount </li>
<li>account for GST in your books </li>

	<h3>GST turnover</h3>
<div><p>GST turnover is your current or projected annual turnover (excluding GST amounts) – whichever is greater. GST turnover is not your profit.</p>
<p>Current annual turnover is:
<ul><li>the value of all sales you made or are likely to make in the current month plus </li>
<li>the value of all sales you made in the previous 11 months.</li></ul></p>
<p>Projected annual turnover is:
<ul><li>the value of all sales you made or are likely to make in the current month plus</li>
<li>the value of all sales you&apos;re likely to make in the next 11 months.</li></ul></p></div>
Must be your ABN start date or later.	<h3>GST start date</h3>
<div><p>If you&apos;re required by law to register for GST, your GST registration should start on the date:
<ul><li>your annual turnover reached &#36;75,000 or more</li>
<li>you started charging passengers for taxi services or limousine travel</li>
<li>you want to start claiming fuel tax credits.</li></ul></p>
<p>If you choose to register for GST, you can choose any start date, as long as it&apos;s the same as or later than your ABN start date.</p>

<blockquote><hr /><strong>Important:</strong> You’re expected to stay registered for at least 12 months. If you apply for your GST registration to be cancelled within 12 months, you may be refused or be required to report monthly.<hr /></blockquote></div>
	<h3>Cash versus Accrual accounting method</h3>
<div>
<h4>Cash accounting method</h4>
<p>Cash accounting tracks the actual money coming in and out of your business. </p>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Example of cash accounting</strong><br />If you send an invoice on Tuesday, and receive the payment in your account on Thursday, you record the income against Thursday&apos;s date in your books. <hr /></blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re using cash accounting if you account for GST on a sale when you receive payment &#40;not when you issue the invoice&#41;.</p>
<p>You can choose the cash accounting method for GST if:
<ul><li>your annual turnover is less than &#36;2 million and you’re a small business</li>
<li>you&#39;re accounting for your income using the cash method for income tax purposes.</li></ul></p>
<p>If you don&#39;t meet any of the criteria above and want to use cash accounting for GST, this may be possible. <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/About-us/Contact-us/">Contact the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</a> to seek permission.</p>
<h4>Accrual accounting method</h4>
<p>If you use accrual accounting, you record expenses and sales when they take place, instead of when cash changes hands.</p> 
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Example of accrual accounting</strong><br />If you&apos;re a builder and have sent an invoice for a project you&apos;ve completed, you record the sale in your books even though you haven&apos;t received payment yet.<hr /> </blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re using an accruals or non-cash accounting method if you account for GST on a sale when you issue an invoice or receive any part of the payment &#45; whichever happens first.</p>

<p>As a guide, here&apos;s how to work out the LCT amount if you sell or import a car:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; (LCT value – <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Luxury-car-tax/Luxury-car-tax-rate-and-thresholds/#LCTthreshold">LCT threshold</a>) x 10/11 x 33%</p>
<p>The LCT value generally includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>any GST, and</li>
<li>the value of any parts, accessories or attachments you supplied or imported at the same time as the car.</li></ul>

</ul>
<h4>Why do I need to provide an estimate?</h4>
<p>The ATO uses your estimate to prefill the LCT amount payable on your first <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Business-activity-statements-(BAS)/">BAS (business activity statement)</a> form before they send it to you.</p><p>The BAS form is for you to report and pay LCT, along with any other tax registrations.</p><p>If you need to, you can change the LCT amount on the BAS form based on your actual sales or imports for that period.</p>

	<h3>Percentage of luxury car turnover</h3>
<div>
<p>For example, say you have luxury car turnover of $10 million.</p>
<p>If $2.5 million is from importing luxury cars and $7.5 million is from manufacturing luxury cars, you would enter:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% for Importing</li>
<li>75% for Manufacturing</li>
<li>0% for Retailing</li>
<li>0% for Wholesaling</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><hr /><strong>Please note:</strong>  When we say turnover, we mean your gross income from luxury cars (not your profit).<br /><br /><hr /></blockquote>

Providing your TFN is the quickest way to prove your identity.	
	<h3>Reporting LCT on your BAS</h3>
<div>
<p>You&apos;ll need to report LCT to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on your BAS, along with any other business taxes you&apos;re registered for.</p>
<p>The ATO will adjust the BAS forms they send out to you, based on your answer to this question.</p>

	<h3>Fuel used in vehicles to travel on public roads</h3>
<div>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) asks this question to help them understand how fuels are used in businesses.</p>
<p>GVM (gross vehicle mass) is the maximum weight a vehicle can carry, including its own weight. It includes the weight of the chassis, body, engine, fuel, accessories, driver, passengers, and load. GVM is set by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>If you <strong>travel on public roads</strong> for business reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>you <strong>can</strong> claim FTC for fuel used in a <strong>heavy</strong> vehicle (GVM greater than 4.5 tonnes)</li>
<li>you <strong>can’t</strong> claim FTC for fuel used in a <strong>light</strong> vehicle (GVM of 4.5 tonnes or less).</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Resident for tax purposes</h3>
<div>
<h4>Individuals (sole traders)</h4>
<p>We need to know if you&apos;re a resident for tax purposes to work out if you&apos;re entitled to an Australian Business Number (ABN). </p>
<p>If you&apos;ve recently arrived in Australia and you&apos;re not sure if you&apos;re a resident, take the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/are-you-a-resident/">are you a resident test</a>.</p>
<h4>Companies</h4>
<p>A company incorporated in Australia is resident in Australia for tax purposes.</p>
<p>A company <strong>not</strong> incorporated in Australia is resident in Australia for tax purposes if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it carries on business in Australia <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>its central management and control is in Australia <strong>or</strong> its voting power is controlled by shareholders who are residents of Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>To work out whether individual shareholders are Australian residents for tax purposes, use the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/are-you-a-resident/">are you a resident test</a> on the Australian Taxation Office website.</p>

	<h3>Percentage of alcoholic beverages turnover</h3>
<div>
<p>For example, say you have alcoholic beverages turnover of $10 million.</p>
<p>If $2.5 million is from selling wine and $7.5 million is from selling spirits, you would enter 25% for Wine and 75% for Spirits.</p>
<blockquote><hr />

	<h3>Agricultural property</h3>
<div><p>This <strong>includes</strong> land used to breed, keep, cultivate or grow all kinds of animals, crops, fruit or vegetables. </p>
<p>This <strong>doesn&apos;t include</strong> land used for forest trees or marine life.</p></div>
Give details of the shares that each shareholder has agreed to take up. The company must have agreement from the shareholder in writing.	
	<h3>Share class</h3>
<div>
<p>Select the share class that the shareholder has agreed in writing to take up.</p>
<h4>What is a share class?</h4>
<p>A company can use different classes of shares to give shareholders different rights (such as different voting powers or different dividend rates). </p> 
<p>To keep it simple, most companies make all their shares <strong>ordinary shares</strong>. The ordinary share class is the most commonly used share class. Ordinary shares give shareholders normal voting and dividend rights.</p>

<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Important! </strong> If you’re not sure what share class to use, consider getting advice from a business advisor or other professional. </p><hr /></blockquote>

<h4>Other standard share classes</h4>
<p>Other standard share classes include: </p>
<ul>
<li>A to F class shares - these shares usually give dividends at different rates compared to ordinary shareholders</li>
<li>preference shares - these shares usually give holders preference in some things, such as priority payment of dividends over other share classes</li>
<li>redeemable shares - depending on their terms of issue, these shares can usually be redeemed at the decision of the company, the shareholder, after a fixed time, or on a specific date. </li>
</ul>

<p>While these share classes are standard, each company can decide on the rights and restrictions attached to them. For example, two companies may issue class A shares, but the rights attached to these shares can be completely different.</p>

<h4>Custom share class</h4>
<p>If the company uses a custom share class, you must provide the following details: </p>
<ul>
<li>Class code - made up of 1 to 4 letters. </li>
<li>Class description - a short phrase that describes the share class. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote><hr /><p>For example, a family-held company has created a special class of shares for family members, which gives an extra dividend based on their contribution to the company. The custom share class code is <strong>FAM</strong> and the class description is <strong>family special dividend</strong>. </p><hr /></blockquote>

	<h3>Shares beneficially held</h3>
<div>
<p>Most shareholders beneficially hold shares. This means the holder of the shares gets the direct benefit from the shares (such as dividend payments).</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p>For example, Paul is the sole director and shareholder of the company Paul Enterprises PTY LTD.</p><p>He receives all the benefits from the company in the form of dividends, which means all his shares are beneficially held.</p><hr /></blockquote>

<p>You <strong>don&apos;t</strong> beneficially hold shares if you hold them:</p>
<ul>
<li>as a <strong>trustee</strong> (the beneficiaries of the trust get the direct benefit of the shares, not you)</li>
<li>as a <strong>nominee</strong> (the person who has nominated you to hold the shares gets the direct benefit of the shares, not you)</li>
<li>on <strong>behalf of another person</strong> (the person you hold them on behalf of gets the direct benefit, not you).</li>

	<h3>State or territory of company registration</h3>
<div>
<p> Once you register a company, it can operate in any state or territory. Company registration is a <strong>national</strong> registration.</p>
<p>However, you still need to choose the state or territory the company is &apos;taken to be registered in&apos;. Most companies choose the state or territory in which they will operate their company.</p>
<p>The company will need to meet any laws of that state or territory that apply to it. For example, stamp duty rates vary between the states and territories.</p>
<div><hr />The state or territory will appear on the certificate of company registration.
<hr /></div>
<p>You can apply to change the state or territory of registration later, but there is a fee to do this. See <a href="http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/forms/forms-folder/2213-application-for-change-of-state-or-territory-of-registration-of-a-company/">Application for change of state or territory of registration of a company</a> on the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) website for details.</p>

If you run your business from multiple locations, add each additional address here by using the button below.	
You have set up, or are about to set up, a new business and have never had an ABN using the same business structure in Australia. 	
For example, if you earn income from an investment.	
You are contracting or sub-contracting your services.	
You need an ABN to receive payment for services. 	
You have restarted a business in the same business structure.	
You have restarted a business in a different business structure.

Why do you need an ABN?	
	<h3>First time in business (Investment)</h3>
<div><p>Answer &apos;Yes&apos; to this question if you&apos;ve never owned or operated a business in Australia. This includes as a sole trader, partner, trustee, director or contractor/subcontractor.</p></div>
	<h3>First time in business (Purchased business)</h3>
<div><p>Answer &apos;Yes&apos; to this question if you&apos;ve never owned or operated a business in Australia. This includes as a sole trader, partner, trustee, director or contractor/subcontractor.</p></div>
Will the address be the main place of business?	
<h3>Main place of business</h3>
<div>
<p>The &apos;main place of business is where the company&apos;s main activity will take place. It must be a street address (not a post box).</p>
<p>It&apos;s up to you to decide what address to use. For example, if the company will:</p>

<ul>
<li>run a <strong>retail store</strong> or a <strong>professional practice</strong>, you could use the street address of this location</li>
<li>be run from a <strong>director&apos;s home</strong>, you could use their residential address (make sure the company has written consent)</li>
<li>conduct its business <strong>online</strong> or at its <strong>customers&apos; premises</strong>, you could use the street address at which the company books and records are kept.</li>
<li>have <strong>multiple business locations</strong>, you could use the head office.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><hr /><p>The address of the main place of business will be available to the public in the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/search-organisations">company register</a>. In the register, it&apos;s called the &apos;<strong>principal</strong> place of business&apos;.</p>
<p>If the company will be run from your home but you&apos;re worried about having your home address available to the public, you can choose to use a different address.</p>

You&apos;re the sole owner of the business, but you can employ staff. You&apos;re responsible for all decisions and losses in your business, and you report the business income in your personal tax return. 	<h3>Sole traders</h3>
<div> <p>A sole trader structure is the easiest and cheapest business structure to set up.</p><p>If you&apos;re a sole trader, you&apos;re the <strong>sole owner of the business</strong>.</p>
    <p>The income your business makes belongs to you. You report the income on your individual tax return and pay tax on your business income at your <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/">individual income tax rate</a>.</p>
    <p>You&apos;re responsible for all decisions and losses in your business. This means you have complete control over your business, but it also means your personal assets are at risk if things go wrong.</p>
    <p>If you employ staff, you&apos;re responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
<blockquote><hr />
    <h4>Example of a sole trader</h4>
    <p>Jason operates his landscaping business as a sole trader, he trades on his own and controls and manages the business. He employs a part-time junior gardener to help out on basic garden maintenance jobs.</p>
    <p>The business income is treated as Jason&apos;s individual income and he is solely responsible for any tax the business must pay. He includes all his business income with any other income and reports it on his individual tax return.</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <h4>Key facts for sole traders</h4>

        <li><strong>Cost</strong> - cheapest structure to set up and run</li>
        <li><strong>Setting up process</strong> - easy</li>
        <li><strong>Owner</strong> - you</li>

        <li><strong>Business tax file number (TFN) needed</strong> - no</li>
        <li><strong>Additional administration</strong> - no</li>
        <li><strong>Additional reporting</strong> - no</li>
        <li><strong>Separate business bank account needed</strong> - no</li>
        <li><strong>Your super</strong> - you&apos;re not considered an employee, so you&apos;re responsible for organising your own superannuation</li>
    </ul>
</div>
You and your partners carry on a business together and share income, losses, and control of the business. The partners in the partnership are not employees but the partnership can employ staff.	<h3>Partnerships</h3>
<div>
    <p>A partnership structure is relatively inexpensive and easy to set up and operate.</p>
    <p>In a partnership structure, <strong>you and your business partners own the business together</strong> and share the income and losses of the business. A partnership can have two or more partners.</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p>You&apos;re in a <em>family</em> partnership structure if two or more of the partners are related.</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <p>Each partner reports their share of the income on their own individual tax return, and pays tax at their <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/" target="_blank">individual income tax rate</a>. The partnership must lodge a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/business/reports-and-returns/income-tax-return/#Partnershipsandpartners" target="_blank">partnership income tax return</a> every year with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
    <p>All partners share legal responsibility for the business. This means the personal assets of all partners are at risk if things go wrong. If some partners want to limit their responsibility for business losses, you might want to consider a limited partnership structure. See below for more information.</p>
    <p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
<blockquote><hr />
    <h4>Example of a partnership</h4>
    <p>Greg and Fiona operate their website business as a partnership. The partnership has its own tax file number (TFN).</p>
    <p>A partnership is not a separate legal entity and doesn&apos;t pay income tax on the income it earns. Instead, Greg and Fiona pay tax on their share of the net partnership income they each receive.</p>
    <p>While the partnership doesn&apos;t pay tax, it does have to lodge an annual partnership tax return to show all income the partnership earned and deductions it claimed for expenses it incurred in carrying on the partnership business. The tax return also shows each partner&apos;s share of the net partnership income.</p>
<hr /></blockquote>
    <h4>Key facts for partnerships</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost</strong> - low cost to set up and run</li>
        <li><strong>Setting up process</strong> - relatively easy</li>
        <li><strong>Owner</strong> - you and your partners</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for business decisions</strong> - you and your partners share</li>
        <li><strong>Responsibility for losses</strong> - you and your partners share</li>
        <li><strong>Report business income</strong> - each partner reports their share in their individual tax return</li>
        <li><strong>Tax rate</strong> - all partners pay their individual tax rate on their share of any business profit</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of losing assets</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Additional administration</strong> - if partners&apos; shares aren&apos;t equal, a partnership agreement is required</li>
        <li><strong>Business tax file number (TFN) needed</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Additional reporting</strong> - yes, an annual partnership return must be lodged at the ATO under the business TFN</li>
        <li><strong>Separate business bank account needed</strong> - yes</li>
        <li><strong>Your superannuation</strong> - you&apos;re not considered an employee, so you&apos;re responsible for organising your own superannuation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Limited partnerships</h4>
    <p>In a limited partnership, there are two types of partners: a general partner and a limited partner. There must be at least one of each.</p>
    <p>General partners are responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and their responsibility for losses (their liability for debt) is unlimited. Limited partners don&apos;t play any role in the day-to-day management of the business, and their liability for debt is limited to the amount they contributed to the partnership.</p>
    <p>You <strong>must</strong> register a limited partnership in your state or territory. Contact your <a href="http://www.australia.gov.au/about-government/states-territories-and-local-government" target="_blank">state or territory government</a> to find out more.</p>
</div>
A company is a separate legal entity from you, and has at least one shareholder (owner) and one director (who runs the business). Income and losses belong to the company. Companies can employ staff.	<h3>Companies</h3>
<div>
    <p>A company structure has higher costs and is more difficult to set up. Running a company can also be more expensive, because you have to meet reporting and other requirements under Australian company law. This is why the structure is generally considered to be better suited to medium to large businesses.</p>
    <p>A company structure means that your business is a <strong>separate legal entity from you</strong>. This means the company has the same rights as a natural person and can have debt, sue and be sued. A company is owned by its shareholders and run by its directors.</p>
    <p>The personal assets of directors and shareholders are separate from the company, so they can&apos;t be used to pay company debts. In certain cases where directors breach their duties, they may be held personally responsible for company losses.</p>
    <p>The income and losses that the business makes belongs to the company, and is reported on a company tax return. The <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Small-business-entity-concessions/Concessions/Income-tax-concessions/Small-business-company-tax-rate/">company tax rate</a> applies to the business income.</p>
    <p>If the company employs staff, the company is responsible for giving them their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>
<blockquote><hr />
    <p>Companies must appoint a <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-professionals/your-practice/tax-and-bas-agents/primary-contact-and-authorised-contacts/#Public_officer">public officer</a> and let the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) know. Public officers are responsible for making sure the company complies with tax law, keeping tax records and submitting company tax returns. The ATO needs to know their details so they can contact them about company tax matters.</p><hr /></blockquote>
    <h4>Proprietary limited company</h4>
<p>Companies can be proprietary (private) or public. Most companies in Australia are proprietary limited. A proprietary limited company generally isn&apos;t allowed to raise money from the public by selling shares (like public companies can).</p>
    <p>They must have:</p>
    <ul>
<li>no more than 50 non-employee shareholders</li>
        <li>at least one shareholder (also known as a member)</li>
        <li>at least one director.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can be both a shareholder and a director. You can also be the sole shareholder and director.</p>

    <p>When companies are &apos;limited&apos;, the liability of shareholders is limited to any unpaid value (if any) on their shares. This means that shareholders can only be responsible for company losses <strong>up to</strong> any amount unpaid on their shares.</p>

Your business is held and controlled for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries). A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses. Trusts can employ staff. 	<h3>Trusts</h3>
<div>
    <p>Using a <strong>trust</strong> structure for your business means that your business is held and controlled by a trustee for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</p>
    <p>A trustee is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses, and must report income in a trust income tax return.</p>
    <p>A trustee can be a company or a person.</p>

        <li><strong>The money you get from the business</strong> - as a beneficiary, you report any distributions on your individual tax return (if you&apos;re the trustee and there is net trust income, you&apos;re taxed at the highest marginal tax rate)</li>
        <li><strong>Tax rate</strong> - depending on the trust deed, the trust may need to pay at the company tax rate. If all income is distributed to adult beneficiaries who are Australian residents, the trust doesn&apos;t need to pay tax.</li>

	<h3>Australian Business Number (ABN)</h3>
<div>
    <p>If you run a business in Australia, you should have an ABN.</p>
    <p>An ABN is a unique 11 digit number that identifies your business to the public, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), and other government agencies. Applying for an ABN is free.</p>
    <h4>Why should I have an ABN?</h4>
    <p>Having an ABN means you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing</li>
        <li>avoid having business clients withhold 46.5% of any payments they make to you</li>
        <li>register a business name</li>
        <li>register an Australian domain name.</li>
    </ul>

	<h3>Company registration</h3><div>
    <p>All companies need to be registered if they&apos;re operating in Australia. The cost of registering a company depends on the type of company. The most common company structure, a proprietary limited company, costs $469 to register.</p>
    <h4> Before you register</h4>

        <li>decide on the officeholders (directors and secretaries)</li>
        <li>choose a company name (that is, the company&apos;s legal name)</li>
        <li>understand your legal obligations as a director and shareholder.</li>
    </ul>

You need to register your business name if it&apos;s different to your own name.
<br /><br /> For example, if your name is Sally Chang, and you want to use the name Accurate Accountants as your business name, you need to register it.	<h3>Registering your business name</h3>
<div><p>Registering a business name means you&apos;re registering it nationally with the  Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC). This means you can use it in any state or territory. It costs $34 to register a business name for 1 year, and $80 for 3 years.</p>
<p>Before you register a business name, make sure it creates the right image for your business, and helps your business to stand out from your competitors.</p>
<p>Find out how you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.business.gov.au/info/plan-and-start/start-your-business/business-and-company-registration/business-name-registration/how-do-i-choose-a-business-name" target="_blank">choose an effective business name</a></li>

</ul>
<h4>Protecting your business name</h4>
    <p>It&apos;s important to know that registering your business name does <strong>not</strong> give you exclusive rights to it! Other businesses won&apos;t be able to register your name, but they can still use it to name a product or service.</p>
<p>If you want to stop others from using your business name, you should register it as a trade mark. Trade marking your business name means that it will be protected in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years. 
You can <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks/applying-for-a-trade-mark/how-to-apply-for-a-trade-mark" target="_blank">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</p>
<h4>Websites and business names</h4>
<p>Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahsflowers.com.au or josephsmitharchitects.com.au.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re keen to have domain name that reflects your business name, it&apos;s a good idea to register a domain name, even if you&apos;re not quite ready to set up your website. 
Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year&apos;s registration. </p>
<p>Read our <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/info/run/advertising-and-online/register-a-website-name" target="_blank">register a website name</a> page for more information. </p>
<h4>Having more than one business name</h4>
<p>You can give your business more than one name, if you have different parts of your business that you want to give different identities. For example, &apos;George&apos;s coffee shop&apos; and &apos;George&apos;s catering services&apos;.</p>
</div>
<p>Registering a business name costs $34 for 1 year, and $80 for 3 years.</p>
<p> Registering a business name doesn&apos;t stop other businesses from using it for their products or services! Find out how you can <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/registering-a-business-name/before-you-start/how-to-protect-your-business-name/">protect your business name</a>.</p>	
You don&apos;t need to register your business name if you&apos;re using the names of all the partners.<br /><br />
For example, if the combined name of all the partners is Stephen White &amp; George Black, and you want to use it (or a shortened form such as S. White &amp; G. Black) as your business name, you don&apos;t need to register it.	<h3>If you don’t need to register your business name</h3>
<div>
<p>While you don&apos;t need to register your business name, it&apos;s a good idea to think about whether your business needs a website or social media accounts, and how you can connect your online presence to your business name.</p>
<h4>Websites and business names</h4>
<p>Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahanderson.com.au or josephsmith.com.au.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re keen to have a domain name that reflects your business, it&apos;s a good idea to register a domain name, even if you&apos;re not quite ready to set up your website. Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year&apos;s registration.</p>

If your business will have two or more owners, you can choose a partnership or company structure - but not a sole trader.	
	<h3>How many owners will your business have?</h3>
<div>
<p>The number of owners may limit which business structure you can choose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A sole trader can only have a single owner.</li>
        <li>A company can have one or more owners.</li>

	<h3>Will you hold and control an asset for the benefit of others? </h3>
<div><p>A trust is where an individual or business manages an asset (estate, property or business) on behalf of beneficiaries (people who receive profits from the asset).

	<h3>Estimate of LCT you will pay in the next 12 months</h3>
<div>
<p>Give a rough estimate of the LCT amount you think you&apos;ll need to pay in the next 12 months. LCT is 33% of the value of a luxury car <strong>above</strong> the LCT threshold.</p>
<p>As a guide, here&apos;s how to work out the LCT amount if you sell or import a car:</p>
<blockquote><hr /><p>(LCT value – <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Luxury-car-tax/Luxury-car-tax-rate-and-thresholds/#LCTthreshold">LCT threshold</a>) x 10/11 x 33%</p><hr /></blockquote>
<p>The LCT value generally includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>any GST, and</li>
<li>the value of any parts, accessories or attachments you supplied or imported at the same time as the car.</li></ul>
<p>Visit the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) website to find out more about:</p>

</div>
	<h3>Number of shares</h3>
<div>
<p>Enter the number of shares the shareholder has agreed in writing to take up.</p>
<p>A company can issue as many shares as it likes, but it must issue at least 1 share to at least 1 shareholder. The split of shares usually shows the percentage split in ownership.</p>
<p>For example, if a company is owned by <strong>2 equal shareholders</strong>, they could take up: </p>
<ul>
<li>50 shares each (representing the 50/50 split) or</li>
<li>just 1 share each.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a company is owned by <strong>1 majority shareholder and 2 other shareholders</strong>, the company could issue 100 shares: </p>
<ul>
<li>60 shares for the majority shareholder, and</li>
<li>20 shares each to the other 2 shareholders.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><hr /><p><strong>Important! </strong> If you’re not sure how many company shares to issue, consider getting advice from a business advisor or other professional.</p><hr /></blockquote>
</div>

	<h3>Amount paid per share</h3>
<div>
<p>Enter the amount the shareholder has paid per share. This may be 100% of the share price that they agreed to in writing, or part of it.</p> 
<p>The amount paid per share depends on the type of shares and whether there were any arrangements made for their purchase. </p> 

<p>The amount <em>paid</em> per share <strong>plus</strong> the amount <em>unpaid</em> per share <strong>must equal</strong> the agreed share price per share.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully paid shares</strong> (where shares are paid up front)<br />
Agreed share price = $10<br />
Amount paid per share = $10<br />
Amount unpaid per share = $0
</li>
<li><strong>Partially paid shares</strong> (where only part payment is required up front)<br />
Agreed share price = $10<br />
Amount paid per share = $7<br />
Amount unpaid per share = $3
</li>
</ul>

<p>The amounts paid for company shares form part of the company&apos;s capital and are usually paid into the company&apos;s bank account.</p>


<blockquote><hr />
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Shares are usually priced between 1 cent and $1 when they’re first issued, but the company can issue them at any price greater than 0. </p>
<p><strong>Important!</strong> If you’re not sure about the price of your shares, consider getting advice from a business advisor or other professional. </p><hr /></blockquote>
</div>
	<h3>Amount unpaid per share</h3>
<div>
<p>Enter the amount <strong>unpaid</strong> per share.</p>
<p>If the shares have been fully paid, enter 0.</p>

<p>Remember: the amount <em>paid</em> per share <strong>plus</strong> the amount <em>unpaid</em> per share <strong>must equal</strong> the agreed share price per share.</p>

<p>Our suggestion is a guide only! Talk to a professional if you&apos;re not sure about what business structure you&apos;d prefer.</p>	
<p>A partnership is where two or more people own a business together and share the income and losses. It’s relatively inexpensive and easy to set up and operate, and generally suits people who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>want to minimise their reporting requirements</li>
    <li>want to use any business losses to offset their other personal income</li>
    <li>want to claim business expenses to reduce their personal income</li>
    <li>have low risk of going into significant business debt</li>
</ul>

    <li>Simple to set up and run</li>
    <li>Minimal reporting requirements</li>
    <li>Your share of the profits belong to you</li>
</ul>	
<ul>
    <li>You risk losing your personal assets if your business goes into debt, even if your partner was responsible</li>
    <li>You’re responsible for organising your own superannuation</li>
    <li>You’re not an employee of your business, so you don’t get paid annual or sick leave</li>
    <li>Sharing business decisions can sometimes result in disputes</li>
</ul>	
<p>Based on your answers, the <strong>company</strong> structure might suit your business needs.</p>	
<p>Our suggestion is a guide only! Talk to a professional if you’re not sure about what business structure you’d prefer.</p>	
<p>A company structure means your business is a <strong>separate legal entity</strong> from you. This means that it can borrow money and be sued like a person.</p>
<p>A company has at least one owner (shareholder) and one director. You can be both.</p>
<p>Companies are expensive and complicated to set up, and generally suit people who:</p>
<ul>
    <li>expect their business income to be highly variable, and want the option to use losses to offset future profits</li>
    <li>think their business has a high risk of going into debt, and want to limit the risk of losing personal assets such as their home (limit their liability).</li>
</ul>	
<p>It’s important to know that companies must meet complex reporting and legal requirements.</p>
	
<ul>
    <li>Limited liability for owners</li>
    <li>Limited liability for directors, if they meet their legal obligations</li>
    <li>Ability to raise money by offering company shares</li>
    <li>Profits can be invested back into the company or distributed to owners</li>
    <li>Easy to sell or pass on to another owner</li>
    <li>Can carry losses forward to offset future profits</li>
</ul>	
<ul>
    <li>Expensive and complicated to set up</li>
    <li>Complex reporting and legal requirements</li>
    <li>Can’t distribute losses</li>
    <li>Limited or no control of company affairs</li>
</ul>	
<p>Trusts are complex to set up and you&apos;ll need time and the right skills to do it properly.</p>
<p>It&apos;s best to see a qualified, licensed professional to help you understand what&apos;s involved and the registrations you&apos;ll need.</p>
<ul>

<p>Based on your answers, the <strong>trust</strong> structure might suit your business needs.</p>	
<p>Our suggestion is a guide only! Talk to a professional if you&apos;re not sure about what business structure you&apos;d prefer.</p>	
<p>In a trust structure, a trustee holds your business for the benefit of others (the beneficiaries).</p>
<p>A trustee can be a person or a company, and is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses.</p>
<p>Trust structures are expensive and complicated to set up, and are generally used to protect the business assets for beneficiaries. The trustee decides how business profits should be distributed to the beneficiaries.</p>	
<p>If profits are invested back into the business, the business must pay penalty tax rates on the profits.</p>	
<ul>
    <li>Business assets are protected</li>
    <li>Limited liability – especially if the trustee is a company</li>
    <li>Flexibility of asset and income distribution</li>
</ul>	
<ul>
    <li>Expensive and complicated to set up</li>
    <li>Difficult to end or change the trust once it’s been set up</li>
    <li>Pay penalty rates on any profits invested back into the business</li>
</ul>	
<p><strong>Based on your answers,</strong> you should consider applying for the below registrations.</p>	
<ul>
    <li><strong>If you’re not sure about the answers you’ve given,</strong> it’s a good idea to chat to your financial advisor or <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/About-us/Contact-us/" target="_blank">contact the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)</a>, who can take into account your complete situation.</li>
    <li>We’ve covered the basic business and tax registrations. We’ll ask for more information about your business when you apply, which will help us work out if your business should consider other registrations.</li>
    <li>Remember - registering your business name doesn&apos;t stop other businesses from using it for their products or services. To stop others from using your business name, you need to <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/get-the-right-ip/trade-marks/apply-for-a-trade-mark/">apply for a trade mark</a>.</li>

<blockquote><hr />
<p>&apos;Usual&apos; residential address means the address that they normally live at for most of the time.</p><hr /></blockquote>
<p>They can apply for approval to use a different Australian address in place of their usual residential address if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Australian Electoral Commission has given them a silent enrolment status, or</li>
<li>their name <strong>isn&apos;t</strong> on the Australian electoral roll <strong>and</strong> having their residential address on the public company register would risk the personal safety of the officeholder or the officeholder&apos;s family.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><hr />The address used in place of the usual residential address must be in Australia and be one where documents can be served on the officeholder. The residential requirements for company officeholders still apply.<hr /></blockquote>

Upload a copy of the company&apos;s constitution. You can upload a Word, PDF or image file.	<h3>Company constitution</h3>
<div>
<p>These types of companies <strong>must</strong> have a written constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public companies limited by guarantee who want to omit the word &apos;Limited&apos; from their company name (under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s150.html">section 150 of the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em></a>)</li>

<div>
<p>All companies must have a registered office in Australia to receive official documents and notices. The registered office is where government agencies, members of the public and others will direct their queries about company matters (and serve legal documents).</p>
<p>The company&apos;s registered office can be wherever you like, as long as it&apos;s a street address in Australia (not a post box).</p>
<p>A company&apos;s registered office could be:</p>
<ul><li>the office of the company&apos;s accountant</li>
<li>the street address of the company&apos;s retail store</li>
<li>the home address of a company director.</li>

In a company limited by shares, the personal liability of shareholders is limited to the amount unpaid (if any) on their shares. 	<h3>Limited by shares</h3>
<div>
<p>&apos;Limited by shares&apos; is the most common class used by public companies in Australia.</p>
<p>When a company is &apos;limited by shares&apos;, the liability of shareholders is limited to any unpaid amount on their shares. The personal assets and property of shareholders can&apos;t be used to pay for any company debts.</p>

<blockquote><hr />
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>One $20 share is issued to a shareholder.</li>
<li>The shareholder pays $15, leaving $5 unpaid.</li>
<li>If the company is wound up, the shareholder maybe be liable to contribute the unpaid $5 to help pay the debts of the company, but nothing more.</li>
</ul>
<hr /></blockquote>
<h4>What about unlimited companies?</h4>
<p>Generally, <strong>unlimited</strong> companies are only used if there is a requirement for shareholders to have unlimited liability. Most businesses don&apos;t have this requirement.</p>
<p>You can&apos;t apply to register unlimited companies here.

<p>This class is generally for not-for-profit or charitable organisations.</p>
<p>When individuals become members of a &apos;limited by guarantee&apos; company, they must agree to contribute an amount if the company is wound up.</p>

<li>doesn&apos;t pay dividends to its members</li>
<li>doesn&apos;t distribute its assets to members if it is wound up.</li>

	<h3>Government control</h3>
<div>
<p>A government controls a company or organisation if the government controls it through either:</p>
<ul>
<li>majority ownership of voting shares</li>
<li>specific legislation, or</li>
<li>the right to appoint and remove most &apos;directors&apos; of the controlling body of the company or organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this control, a government agency can influence the operations of a company or organisation. </p>
<p>A company or organisation <strong>isn&apos;t</strong> controlled by a government simply because it receives most of its funding from a government.</p>
<p>Governments at all levels (Commonwealth, state, territory and local) can control a company or organisation. </p> 
</div>

	<h3>Public officers</h3>
<div>

<h4>Family and other partnerships</h4>
<p>There is no legal paperwork required to form a family or other partnership. However, there are legal responsibilities that come with being a partner.</p>
<p>Each partner must report their share of the income on their own individual tax return, and pay tax at their <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/">individual income tax rate</a>. </p>
<p>The partnership must also lodge a partnership <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Yearly-reports-and-returns/Income-tax-return/" target="_blank">income tax return</a> every year with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<p>All partners share legal responsibility and any debt equally. </p>
 <p>If your business employs staff, all partners are responsible for giving staff their minimum employee entitlements and conditions (such as superannuation and leave).</p>

<h4>Limited partnerships</h4>
<p>Partners in a limited partnership must register the partnership and comply with their relevant state or territory partnership legislation. This legislation is administered by the <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/info/run/fair-trading/fair-trading-laws">Consumer affairs or Fair trading office</a> in each state and territory.</p>
<p>A limited partnership is considered a company for tax purposes and the partnership must lodge a company tax return with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).</p>
<p>Not all partners share legal responsibility for the business. The limited partners only share responsibility and debt according to the limitations set out in the state or territory registration. </p>

<div><p>A deceased estate is a type of trust that has property or a business that needs to be administered following the death of the owner. Usually the terms of this administration are detailed in the will of the deceased owner or by a court. </p>

<p>To be a deceased estate you must:</p>
<ul><li>be carrying on the business of a deceased person that needs to have its affairs in order</li>
<li>apply for a Tax File Number (TFN)</li>
<li>apply for an Australian Business Number (ABN)</li>
<li>have an executor named in a will or an administrator appointed by a court.</li></ul>

<blockquote><hr /><strong>Please note:</strong> This form does not set up a decease estate! You must already be a deceased estate to continue with your application.<hr /></blockquote>

<h4>Not already a deceased estate?</h4>
<p>It&apos;s best to see a qualified, licensed professional to help you understand what’s involved. You can also:</p>
<ul><li>Check the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/deceased-estates/deceased-estate-checklist/">Deceased estate checklist</a> on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) website.</li>

<br /><br /> For example, if your name is Sally Chang, and you want to use the name Accurate Accountants as your business name, you need to register it.	
You need to register a business name if it&apos;s different to your company name (the legal name you give your company when you register it).<br /><br />
For example, if your company name is Dairy Exports Pty Ltd and you want to carry on a business under the name Fresh Dairy Products, you need to register Fresh Dairy Products as a business name.	
You need to register your business name if it&apos;s different to the names of all the partners.<br /><br />
For example, if the names of the partners are Stephen White &amp; George Black, and you want to use the name Black &amp; White Accountants as your business name, you need to register it.	
You don&apos;t need to register your business name if you&apos;re using your own name.<br /><br />For example, if your name is Joe Aaron Smith, and you want to use it (or a shortened form such as Joe Smith, J Smith, or J. A. Smith) as your business name, you don&apos;t need to register it.	
You don&apos;t need to register a business name if it&apos;s the same as your company name (the legal name you give your company when you register it).<br /><br />
For example, if your company name is Dairy Exports Pty Ltd and you want to carry on a business under this name, you don&apos;t need to register it as a business name.	
You don&apos;t need to register your business name if you&apos;re using the names of all the partners.<br /><br />
For example, if the combined name of all the partners is Stephen White &amp; George Black, and you want to use it (or a shortened form such as S. White &amp; G. Black) as your business name, you don&apos;t need to register it.

 <p>Setting up a sole trader structure is relatively easy. Generally, you’re ready to go once you get your Australian Business Number (ABN) and register for any taxes, licences and permits. It’s recommended you set up a separate bank account, but it’s not necessary.</p>
 <h4>Setting up as a company</h4>
 <p>Setting up a company is more complicated, and you must understand your legal and tax obligations before registering. On top of the typical business and tax registrations, licences and permits you&apos;ll also need to set up a separate bank account and ensure the company has a <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/changes-to-your-company/company-addresses/" class="external-link" target="_blank">registered office and principal place of business</a>.</p>

	<h3>Residential address</h3>
<div>
<p>Residential address means the address that the individual normally lives at for most of the time.</p>
<p>The residential address of the following business associates will be available to the public in the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/search-organisations">company register</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>individual shareholders in the top 20 of each share class (based on shareholdings)</li>
<li>officeholders (directors and secretaries).</li>
</ul>
<p>If an officeholder has approval from Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) to use an address that&apos;s different to their residential address, enter it here. Later in the form, we&apos;ll ask you to provide the <strong>ASIC approval number</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><hr />
<p>Officeholders can apply for approval to provide a different address in some circumstances. For example, if providing the residential address would risk the safety of the officeholder or their family.</p>

<p>Visit the ASIC website for information about the application fee and how to <a href="http://asic.gov.au/for-business/changes-to-your-company/company-addresses/application-for-suppression-of-residential-address/">apply for suppression of residential address</a>.</p>

<li>the symbols  &#124;  -   _  \   / &#64;  &#35;  &#36;  &#37;  &#42;   &#61;  &amp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Letters with an accent are <strong>not</strong> accepted. For example: &#224;, &#233;, &#265; or &#231;.</p>

<blockquote><hr />For example: Lisa wants to register &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233; Ltd&apos;. <br /><br />Although her name will need to be registered as &apos;LISA&apos;S CAFE LTD&apos;, she can still use &apos;Lisa&apos;s Caf&#233; Ltd&apos; on her marketing, signage and receipts.<hr /></blockquote>
