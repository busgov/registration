<h3>Business names</h3>
<div>
    <p>Your business name not only identifies you to your customers, but also allows you to differentiate yourself from your competitors and enables your customers to make an emotional connection to your business and brand. For many businesses, a business name is often the most valuable asset.</p>
    <h4>Protect your business name</h4>
    <p>If you want to stop anyone else using your business name, you should register it as a trade mark. Trade marking your business name means that it will be protected in all Australian states and territories for an initial period of 10 years.</p>
    <p>You can <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/get-the-right-ip/trade-marks/apply-for-a-trade-mark/" target="_blank">apply for a trade mark</a> on the IP Australia website.</p>
    <h4>Websites and business names</h4>
    <p>Website addresses are called domain names, for example, sarahsflowers.com.au. </p>
    <p>If you’re keen to have domain name that reflects your business name, it’s a good idea to register a domain name, even if you’re not quite ready to set up your website.</p>
    <p>Generally prices range from $10 to $100 AUD for a year's registration. </p>
