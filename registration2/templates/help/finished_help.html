    Australian Business Number (ABN)
</h3>
<div id="abnHelp">
    <p>
        If you run a business in Australia, you should have an ABN.
    </p>
    <strong>
        What is an ABN?
    </strong>
    <p>
        An ABN is a unique 9 digit number that identifies your business to the public, the Tax Office, and other government agencies.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Why should I have an ABN?
    </strong>
    <p>
        Having an ABN means you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            confirm your business identity to others when ordering and invoicing
        </li>
        <li>
            avoid having business clients withhold 46.5% of any payments they make to you
        </li>

        <li>
            register a business name
        </li>
        <li>
            register an Australian domain name.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You also need to have an ABN if you register for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Goods and Services Tax (GST)
        </li>

    <strong>What is GST?</strong>

    <p>GST is a tax of 10% on most goods and services sold in Australia. The money raised by GST is given to the state and territory governments, to provide public services to their communities.</p>
    <p>Businesses collect GST on the goods and services they sell and forward it to the Tax Office.</p>

    <strong>What do I need to do?</strong>
    <p>
        If you’re registered for GST, you’ll need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            work out which goods and services you sell are subject to GST
        </li>
        <li>
            include GST in the prices you charge for those goods and services
        </li>

    <h3>
        What is GST?
    </h3>
    <p>
        GST is a tax of 10% on most goods and services sold in Australia. The money raised by GST is given to the state and territory governments, to provide
        public services to their communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Businesses collect GST on the goods and services they sell and forward it to the Tax Office.
