<h3>Do you want to separate your personal income and assets (such as your home) from your business?</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        If you think your business is at a high risk of going into debt (owing money to other businesses or people), then it could be a good idea to separate your personal income and assets from your business.
        But if you’re at low risk, you may want to keep things simple and report your business and personal income together in your personal tax return.
    </p>
    <h4>Examples of low risk</h4>

    <p>In general, you could be considered at low risk of going into debt if you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            don’t have to borrow a lot of money to get your business going, and
        </li>
        <li>
            your business is relatively simple.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For example, if you’re:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            selling graphic design services online
        </li>
        <li>
            making timber furniture by order, and you buy supplies as you get orders in and use an existing woodworking workshop at home
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>
        Examples of high risk
    </h4>
    <p>
        In general, you could be considered at high risk of going into debt if you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            borrow a lot of money into your business to get it going, or
        </li>
        <li>
            if the nature of the business is risky.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For example, if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            you have to take out a big loan to buy machinery and equipment to start a construction business
        </li>
        <li>
            you buy houses on prime real estate to knock down and rebuild, and sell at a profit
        </li>
        <li>
            you speculate on the sharemarket on behalf of wealthy clients
        </li>
    </ul>

<div id="helpMeDecideQ3Help" style="display:none">
    <p>Depending on the structure you choose, you may be able to take business losses in one year and carry them forward to offset profits in future years, to reduce the amount of tax your business has to pay.</p>
    <p>This may be useful if you expect your business income to vary a lot from one year to the next.</p>
