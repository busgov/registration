    <p>Based on your answers, the <strong>sole trader</strong> structure might suit your business needs.</p>
    <p>Remember, you can always change your business structure as your business needs change.</p>

    <h2>Why sole trader?</h2>
    <p>Because you indicated:</p>
    <ul>

            <strong>Your business will only have one owner - you.</strong>
            <p>
                Businesses using the sole trader structures can only have one owner. Remember! Sole traders can employ staff – sole traders don’t have to work on their own.

            </strong>
            <p>
                As a sole trader your liability is unlimited, which means your personal assets can be used to pay business debts. Sole traders with a low risk of going into debt may want to keep personal and business affairs together to minimise paperwork and keep things simple.

    <h3>What is a company?</h3>
    <p>A company structure means your business is a <strong>separate legal entity</strong> from you. This means that it can borrow money and be sued like a person.</p>
    <p>A company has at least one owner (shareholder) and one director. You can be both.</p>
    <p>Companies are expensive and complicated to set up, and generally suit people who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>expect their business income to be highly variable, and want the option to use losses to offset future profits</li>
        <li>think their business has a high risk of going into debt, and want to limit the risk of losing personal assets such as their home (limit their liability)</li>

    <p>A trustee can be a person or a company, and is responsible for everything in the trust, including income and losses.</p>
    <p>Trust structures are expensive and complicated to set up, and are generally used to protect the business assets for beneficiaries. The trustee decides how business profits should be distributed to the beneficiaries.</p>
