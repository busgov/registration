                                <h3>Do you need to register?</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>You must register for GST if you run a business or enterprise and your GST turnover is $75,000 or more ($150,000 or more for non-profit organisations). GST turnover is your business's gross income, not your business's profit.</p>
                                    <p>It is your responsibility to register if your turnover exceeds the relevant threshold or is likely to exceed it. If you are not registered for GST, check each month to see whether you have reached your threshold. You must register within 21 days of reaching the threshold.</p>
                                    <p>You must also register for GST, regardless of turnover, if you:</p>
                                    <ul class="content">
                                      <li>want to claim fuel tax credits for your business</li>
                                      <li>provide taxi travel</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If your GST turnover is below the threshold, registering for GST is optional. However, if you choose to register, you generally must stay registered for at least 12 months.</p>
                                    <p>You only register once for GST even if you operate more than one business through the same entity. For example, the company ABC Pty Ltd operates two businesses, ABC Hardware Supplies and ABC Plumbers. ABC Pty Ltd registers once for GST. This registration covers both businesses.</p>
                                    <p>If you're registered for GST, you're entitled to claim input tax credits for the GST paid on items you've bought for business use. If you're not registered, you can't claim input tax credits.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>What happens if I don't register for GST?</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>If your GST turnover is under $75 000 and you don't register for GST, you won't include a GST component in your prices. This means that any invoices you provide will need to show that GST was not included in the purchase price. You also can't claim GST credits for your business purchases.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>Small business GST concessions</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>If your business has an annual turnover of less than $2 million, you may be able to access the following GST concessions.</p>
                                    <h4>Accounting for GST on a cash basis</h4>
                                    <p>You can account for GST in the same tax period you receive payments from your customers and claim input tax credits for making payments to your suppliers.</p>
                                    <h4>Paying GST by instalments</h4>
                                    <p>You can pay GST by instalments each quarter based on what you or the Australian Tax Office (ATO) estimates your GST liability to be. You can vary this amount each quarter.</p>
                                    <h4>Annual apportionment of GST input tax credits</h4>
                                    <p>You can claim a full input tax credit for a business purchase that you intend to use partly for private purposes and make a single adjustment to account for the private use percentage at the end of your income year.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>Taxi travel</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>'Taxi travel' means transporting passengers by taxi or limousine for fares. The requirement to register if you provide taxi travel applies to both owner drivers and people who lease a taxi on a daily or other basis.</p>
                                    <p>GST obligations if you provide taxi travel:</p>
                                    <ul class="content">
                                      <li>Completing your activity statement â€“ instructions for taxi drivers</li>
                                      <li>Activity statement payment cards</li>
                                      <li>Taxi driver takings and expenses worksheet</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If your business doesn't fit into one of the above categories, you don't have to register for GST.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>When do I need to register?</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>If you haven't registered for GST, and you become aware that your GST turnover will exceed the $75 000 per year threshold, you will have to register for GST within 21 days.</p>
                                    <p>It's a good idea to check each month to ensure you're not likely to go over the over the limit. Keeping an eye on your GST turnover is important so you can register if necessary.</p>
                                    <p>If your GST turnover is below the 75,000, registering for GST is optional.</p>
                                    <p>You may choose to register if your GST turnover is below the $75,000 threshold, however this means that once registered, regardless of your turnover, you must include GST in your fees and claim GST credits for your business purchases.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>What are GST credits?</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>GST credits are a potential amount of money your business might be able to claim from the ATO. If you are registered for GST, you can claim back the GST that has been included in the purchase price of something you've bought for your business.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>I am still not sure...</h3>
